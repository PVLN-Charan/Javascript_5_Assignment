// Description

// You are given a number stored in a variable with the nameN

// You have to printNlines such that on each line you find the sum of all odd numbers in the range of[1,i], whereirepresents all the numbers in the range of[1,N]

// For example, consider the value stored inN = 3

// Then, first we find the sum of all even numbers, in the range of [1,1], which comes out to be 1, as there is one odd number (1) in the range

// Then, we find the sum of all even numbers, in the range of [1,2], which comes out to be 1, as there is only 1 odd number (1). Hence, the sum becomes 1

// Finally, we find the sum of all even numbers in the range of [1,3], which comes out to be 4, as there are two odd numbers (1,3) in the given range. Hence, the sum becomes 4

// Therefore, the final output becomes

// 1
// 1
// 4

//output
// 1
// 1
// 4
// 4

function oddSumAgain(num) {
    // Write code here
    var odd = 0;
   for( var i = 1; i <= num; i++){
           if(i % 2 == 1){
                odd=odd+i;
            }
            console.log(odd)     
   }
